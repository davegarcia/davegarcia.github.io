            <h1>So you've been turned down for work. Now what?</h1>
            <p>“Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”</p>

<p>Now that the 1st quarter of the new year is almost gone and the season for new goal setting has pretty much come and gone too, let’s invest some time to track our progress and regroup. This is the time of a new year to fulfill old goals with some new approaches. Let’s re-evaluate our approach and re-approach and target a different result</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Rely on your partners. This could be a peer in the firm, friend or spouse, but colleagues or mentors tend to work best with work-related goals. For instance, if you want to learn Google Adwords, create mini-goals, write it down and most importantly, tell your peer partner. Check in with each other every other week and be sure to help her or him to commit to his or her own goals as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reconnect with one dormant contact every month. Adam Grant, Wharton professor and best-selling author of “Give and Take,” agrees: “Research shows that the people you used to know are more helpful sources of advice than the people you know right now. Your former colleagues and your college roommates have been learning new things and meeting different people in the past few years, so they can open up access to novel ideas and opportunities.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do a five-minute favor every month. Yes, paying it forward can really make a difference. After so many years in the business, too many of us tend to hold back on helping others because we can’t afford or have the time to be Mother, Sister or Big Brother to everyone. But the truth is, many acts of meaningful professional generosity can be done in five minutes or less. How about an introduction between two people who could benefit from knowing each other or a note to acknowledge and appreciate someone whose work normally goes unrecognized. A five minute favor can lead to a life-time of communication. And even more opportunities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’re all vulnerable. It’s a conversation starter and a communication launcher when we admit a shortcoming. Maybe not a massive shortcoming and certainly NOT something they are trying to overcome right now. But it could be a vulnerability in us they feel they’ve over come in their past and would enjoy passing on the success. Professionally or socially shared success builds confidence in each other</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build deeper relationships with your contacts.  You can build stronger relationships by sharing a story in newsletters, blog post or on social media. A hyper-link can even strengthen a relationship you never knew you had.  You can even “relate to them” by opening up and sharing professional struggles you have faced and over-come. That builds confidence on several fronts. You connect emotionally and inspire success like yours.  And with the people who are in the midst of the struggles you’ve overpowered. By sharing you opinion of a story (that may have nothing to do with you,) or someone else’s blog posts you can lead clients to their successful outcome. And you gain credibility while becoming more reliable! Build a deeper relationship and make it easier for them to look for more than your expertise in a single matter – help them feel connected to you.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Play on a Winning Team. You don’t always have to blog about yourself. Or be the subject of every newsletter just because it’s yours!  You can build your personal brand by talking about team mates or colleagues you admire. It not only builds a stronger relationship with them by introducing them to your professional circle, it also highlights to others your taste for success. Don’t worry; you can focus on their projects and not necessarily themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never stop being the “Smartest Kid in Class”. Of course you need a class in which to be the smartest. So, take a class.  It can be something you’ve always wanted “to do.” Something that excites you or resurrects an old interest. It can even be on-line, or at church. Find a way to expand your career path with leisure pursuit.  They are often NOT mutually exclusive and more often than not, introduce you to a new lead and help you to even meet other career goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get “Professionally Restless”. It’s one thing to write a list of goals, it’s another to add a timeline to them. Writing out your plan puts them into perspective but by adding a timeline, your goals become more urgent, attainable and helps hold you accountable to achieving your goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t forget there are Multi-Platforms of Communication. Some better than others for certain jobs. A handwritten note v. an email. Don’t forget to do it though! Email just makes it easier to remember to do, not easier to express your thoughts. The delay may even add excitement to it’s arrival and emphasize how much you actually care and while everyone else just clicks “reply,” this professional takes the time to write a detailed personalized note.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use that personality that “got you where you are.” Don’t be afraid of sharing your personal interest, expertise or hobbies. Just know when. People want to invest in more than just history.  Maybe you’re a very happy member of your local parish or you’ve played Polo in college? What makes you stand out makes you stand strong as well! And they serve as an introduction, an “ice breaker” if you will to more important communication. Leaders want to associate with someone they can see themselves chatting with outside of an agenda.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build your LinkedIn profile for where you’re headed not necessarily where you’ve been.  Many leaders don’t necessarily understand how “truly impactful” their LinkedIn profile can be. Some even make the mistake of just listing the basics on their profile, and they’re actually misusing this important platform of communication Use that creativity you want to use in your next case or project. Show off that creativity you will bring to the table. Get creative with your headline, create one that impresses YOU! Sure, describe who you are as an overall professional, but also  go beyond a mini-résumé. Upload work samples, success stories, and awards. Write a bio that says what your résumé can’t. Let leaders know; while you’re happy where you are, you still have career plans for the future and your professional goals includes their success!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get more involved with your industry. This speaks volumes about your dedication to your profession and career, Join industry associations. Even create a blog about your industry and invite others to share, it shows potential referrals you care about advancing your profession and you are and will be a voice within your industry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember Networking is a Communication Platform. Networking events are a pain. Especially, if it involves time away from your family or time outside the office. Don’t think of it as time away from your priorities, thank of it as a time to accomplish one of your priorities. Time well spent as an opportunity to find your next big professional encounter. Step outside your comfort zone and hand-pick attendees to research before the event. Get your approach ready. Don’t just attend the event…USE the event.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be a better Welder… Attorney… Marketer… Know more. If you’re looking to advance within your industry give everyone a reason to think you’re better. We’ve all run across a skill gap within our profession. Find it and become the newest resident expert on that topic. Show you’re proactive by educating yourself on a new or changing trend. It’s all about what you do, not just what you’ve done. Now you’re more “want-able.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“NO!” maybe only a temporary condition. You know, all negotiations begin with the word NO.  It’s not a challenge unless someone first said “No!” However, to be the first, someone had to first believe it’s worth doing. Be that professional. Be the one with the power to say “yes, I did it!” Make it why not me?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Communication is an important part of changing “what is” to “what can be.”   Be inspired and inspire.</p>
