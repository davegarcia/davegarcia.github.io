            <h1>How I find work (and employees) on LinkedIn</h1>
            <p>“It’s not Facebook. It’s a professional, business-oriented site packed full of contacts and resources that can assist you in landing your next job.”
–Tara Goodfellow, managing director, Athena Educational Consultants</p>

<p>While more than 225 million people are LinkedIn, not everyone is using it most effectively. Expert service professionals force themselves off-line when they under use or misuse this Communication Platform.</p>

<p>Let’s first talk “Under use:</p>

<p>While it’s not essential to be on LinkedIn to find your next client; professionals who fail to take advantage are doing themselves a huge disservice. I have found many decision makers and board members are now using LinkedIn as their No. 1 method of researching and sourcing expert professional help. Those who can provide the service and who have a presence on the site are far more likely to be noticed (and contacted) by those centrally involved with contracting expert help.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at misuse:</p>

<p>Using LinkedIn wrong can be just as risky. While you are working for a company your profile (see: character) is an extension of that company. Writing things like “Looking for my next opportunity” is an immediate red flag to most decision makers about your discretion and attitude.</p>

<p>Use LinkedIn properly – A successful sounding profile is worthless if it without clear focus, disorganizes or irrelevant. Others will take it as you don’t really know what you want, or what you’re exactly doing, You become lost and actually in need of help yourself…Not what professionals need in terms of service. An example: I recently was looking for an account service professional to assist in a large project. I came across a profile from a young professional who had won multiple awards and held leadership positions. BUT, none in the same field!</p>

<p>It’s not rocket science (or my basic advice).
Expand your profile. Many professionals treat their LinkedIn profile as an on line résumé. Great if you’re looking for a job. No so much if you’re a professional looking to expand in your industry. Your profile offers the opportunity to provide decision makers and board members with a much more comprehensive impression of your experience and success – along with more flexibility – than a standard advertisement. Don’t just be a cut and paste the latest ad you’ve bought in the city magazine paper. Be collaborative, posting not just your bench mark success, but also ask for opinions, share thought provoking content, give shout outs to speaks and professionals you have connected with!</p>

<p>Use keywords not buzz words.  Decision makers who search for help on LinkedIn do so largely through a keyword search.  You must pay special attention to words and titles when you create the effective profile.</p>

<p>Use exact terminology, you may also want to use terms like ‘situation management’ or ‘union relationships’ somewhere in your text, along with negotiations because it’s possible a decision maker would use those keywords in their search instead of “legal direction” or Lawyers.</p>

<p>Give some real thought to synonymous titles and terms, and utilize them in your profile.</p>

<p>Change your mindset: the more you focus content on the desire to be found, the more likely you will be to appear in someone’s search results.</p>

<p>Help people to feel like they’ve always known you. One of the main purposes for using LinkedIn is for decision makers to get to know you before they meet you. So one of your goals in creating your effective LinkedIn presence should be to reproduce your “complete-self” as accurately as possible onto your profile page – especially in your summary section.</p>

<p>Anyone should be able to read your concise summary and see you as a value adding person, not just a collection of skills.  Your LinkedIn profile should inspire the manager to want you on the team.</p>

<p>Show everyone you can WIN awards, not necessarily you’ve WON awards. You can be someone who’s received awards in the past, or you can be someone who continues to win awards. It’s okay to be the “smartest kid in the room.” Let us know you speak foreign languages, worked on big name projects that’s what belongs in your summary in an organized, narrative flow. While others have put that in their Experience section, you have it up front in the Summary. That way if the decision maker didn’t make all the way to the Experience section or doesn’t put much strength in the past, you’ve already put it before them. Because if you don’t give people a reason to read your experience, they won’t.</p>

<p>Link widely. Set a goal for the number and types of contacts you want. It’s difficult to do without expert help but you can expand or shrink these expectations as you move ahead. This way you can take steps to make those goals a reality. Just to let you know more than 250 contacts is a good starting goal. A good LinkedIn effort requires about 20 minutes a day of attention. That’s too much for most active professionals. But a common Purpose and Mission will allow staff to help you pay attention to the site. A good way to start is through Group Association, BUT  it’s only a way to get started, As soon as you are seeing results. It’s always better to stand alone in a search.</p>

<p>Anyone you know is fair game to connect with on the site. The bigger the network, the more accessible you will be to others, and the more you know about them.</p>

<p>Remember personal friends, former classmates and so on. If you’ve lost touch with the, they’ve traveled a different path with different contacts and now maybe the time to reach out to them.</p>

<p>You’re an expert ready to help and there are other experts ready to help you. Marketing yourself without others is about as much fun doing your own root-canal and usually just as successful. There’s pretty good wisdom in outsourcing tasks not your forte or that you dislike. For example: in the past I have found a social media expert who I like and likes me. Besides sharing projects I have spent time ensuring he can articulate my brand and me, his. When he needs to convince a client to use my services we share a cohesive brand image.</p>

<p>A good craftsman never blames his tools, and LinkedIn is one of the best. Use it to the fullest extent. It’s a chance for the person in the story to tell the story.</p>
