            <h1>Social Sourcing is the next big wave to influence the hiring process.</h1>
            <p>Professional recruiters have now passed the 100 million mark in scouring unblocked online activities on Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and many more social media sites. All to answer three key questions in real time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Who are you?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>3, How do I contact you?</p>

<p>Companies are now building professional digital résumés on just about every Twitter user – not only their profession but also their skills, their experience, where they come from, what they do (even in their spare time,) their hobbies and more.</p>

<p>Media companies with troves of big data are engaging both industry leaders and business clients looking for the next contact. Services may differ in the platforms and algorithms used, but all enable decision makers to target and follow potential professional services, often years before they are ready to offer a contract. And BOTH sides have something to gain by riding the wave. Imagine, knowing who is going to need your services before they know!  And what about feeling assured the expert firm you need will have the specialist in their company before the specialist has even graduates!</p>

<p>While this trend of real-time social/professional recruiting hasn’t yet made its way down the whole corporate ladder, that time is coming and you should prepare. There’s already enhanced information about tens of thousands of firms that advertise on social media everyday directly to a well-qualified decision maker’s Twitter feed, even if they aren’t looking for help in that profession.</p>

<p>In some tight markets shopping for a firm is already a thing of the past, having given way to dossiers compiled by companies searching for those who need help finding what they may not know they need…YET!</p>

<p>If you’re online there is no such thing as putting up dividing walls separating what you do and where you do it. Today’s analytics allow companies to delve under the surface of each post anyone makes and join it with information others in your circle (friends, family, colleagues even adversaries post elsewhere.) They can easily determine where you are from your tweets, and what you are interested in based on your Facebook, LinkedIn and Yahoo Answers posts (among others). They can join this data to your listening history on Spotify and Pandora, etc., and come up with a pretty accurate picture of your education, interests and the kind of service you are likely to provide.</p>

<p>Algorithms troll the entire Internet to find people of interest. Here’s what we should know:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>BELIEVE the future is already here. Use it to your advantage rather than complaining about your lack of privacy. Everyday demonstrate your professional skills, or at least talk about them. Find a way to post or get someone to post somewhere whatever you think will be of interest to a potential client and curate your own online presence carefully.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t simply Engage but Seek Out social conversation. You don’t have to be the one who does original research and publishes it in world-class journals, but you should be commenting, writing or talking about significant developments in your industry. What you think of other’s activities contribute to your showing your knowledge and expertise in any of your fields of interest. And this can be all it takes to get your message found, not what somebody else thinks of your expertise.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Many decision makers riding this wave have found the professional they want, not by what’s posted but by According to Burton, when seeking programmers for the C computer language, he found a perfect candidate who was working in Five Guys flipping hamburgers, all because the individual lists of those taking classes online. “Need a new seismologist with the latest training? He’s going to graduate next year from a school in …!”</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>LinkedIn groups are huge. And they are mined by all kinds of companies. Ask intelligent questions, provide answers and further the conversations. You will soon be considered what’s called a thought leader and gain the attention your firm needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn about and take part in sites like: Quora.com A social question and answer site encompassing all kinds of general information. It’s not “official though and much misinformation can be exchanged, primarily quality assurance is crowdsourced. Yahoo Answers is a similar and worthwhile. There are equivalent sites in just about every profession where professionals gather to learn from one another and talk.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the end: If you want to be viewed as a truly desirable company or firm, you must actively engage online. If you want people to be interested in you, be interesting!</p>
